# 📅 Calendo - Smart Calendar-Based To-Do App

Welcome to **Calendo**, a productivity app designed to combine a powerful to-do list with a dynamic calendar view. Manage your tasks, plan your days, and stay on top of your goals with a sleek, user-friendly interface.

This project is my first app development effort, and I’m building it using **Flutter** to take full advantage of its flexibility and rich UI capabilities. Contributions from the open-source community are welcome!

## ✨ Features (In Progress)
- **Interactive Calendar View**: Swipe through dates to see and manage tasks dynamically.
- **Task Management**: Add, edit, delete, and organize tasks seamlessly.
- **Reminders**: Push notifications for timely task completion (coming soon).
- **Dark Mode**: A modern, dark-themed design for focus and comfort.
- **Offline Support**: Manage tasks even without an internet connection.

## 🛠️ Technologies
- **Flutter**: Cross-platform framework for building high-performance mobile apps.
- **Dart**: Programming language powering the Flutter framework.
- **Provider**: State management for reactive UI updates.
- **Sqflite**: Local database for offline task storage.
- **Intl**: For formatting dates and times.
